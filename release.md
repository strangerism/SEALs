# SEALs

This mod is a configurator to add badges (seals) on the weapons icons in the inventory and item details tooltips.

Seals are meant to represent certifications of provenience, like modders tag, modpack exclusives, manufacturers, or features support (3DSS etc.), mod support (Black Market, Loot boxes, etc) or qualities (unique weapons, quest rewards, etc)   

At the end of the day, it is what you make out of it.

# Usage

The mod is built as community tool to create content. 

You can use the mod with some configs I made for myself or make your own.

# How to install

Installation it's easy with the ready made configs, however there is some reading to be done if you want to do the advanced and creative stuff.

GAMMA and 3DSS seals requires you to understand how to install and use the SEALs CLI and a few basic commands. Consider this task akin to advanced Anomaly modlists tweaking.

Everything is documented at the project home https://github.com/strangerism/SEALs - A must go destination

**Download the main mod** from here https://github.com/strangerism/SEALs/releases

    Use the `SEALs.zip` archive to install the main mod. It's all you need to use the ready made configs 

    To use the GAMMA and 3DSS seals you need to install also the `SEALs_CLI.zip` archive

    To make your own seals you need also the `SEALs_Config-Template.zip`

Configs are found at their own repository https://github.com/strangerism/SEALs-Config

**Download the configs** from here https://github.com/strangerism/SEALs-Config/releases

    get what you need and install in MO2 alongside the main mod, load order is not important.
